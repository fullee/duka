1 special suggestion
!!! It is recommended that every client who wants to use the development kit run the test program first
!!! No problem at all, just start to look at the development kit
!!! If there is any problem in the test, solve the problem first

2 The development kit is classified by system and supports the following five systems
    Android:
        android_as
    iPhone:
        ios_xcode_objectc (oc samples)
        ios_xcode_swift (swift samples)
    mac:
        macos_xcode_objectc (oc samples)
    Linux:
        linux_make_desktop (desktop samples, include library for x86 and x64)
        linux_make_embedded (cross-compiled samples, need toolchains to compile)
    Windows:
    	windows_csharp (c# samples)
    	windows_qt (qt samples)
    	windows_vs_cpp (VC/C++ samples)
    	windows_java (java samples)

3 Each development kit contains a generated APK or EXE that can be tested directly
  Each development package contains six test programs, as shown below:
    samplepos
      esc/pos print, with autoreply

    samplepage
      esc/page print, with autoreply

    samplelabel
      label print, with autoreply

    samplepos_withoutautoreply
      esc/pos print, without autoreply

    samplepage_withoutautoreply
      esc/page print, without autoreply

    samplelabel_withoutautoreply
      label print, without autoreply

4 Integrated description
  In order, 
  If the port is not enabled, enable the port
  If the port has been opened, send various commands to print text bar code two-dimensional code pictures
  There are a lot of functions, but that's what the flow is all about

  In a nutshell, it looks like this:
  if (!CP_Port_IsConnectionValid(h)) {
      CP_Port_Close(h);
  }
  if (!CP_Port_IsOpened(h)) {
      h = CP_Port_OpenXXX();
  }
  if (CP_Port_IsOpened(h)) {

    // This can send any instruction as needed, as long as the printer supports it
    // Specific what function what function, can you see the corresponding model of the example
    // The function is more, but the flow is more fixed, is in order up one instruction code, it forms a document
    CP_Pos_XXX
    ... 
    CP_Pos_XXX

  }
  In detail, please test the example first, and then look at the code.

  Note: It is recommended to re-open the port every time for network port printing, because if no data is sent within 10 seconds, the printer will automatically close the network port connection
